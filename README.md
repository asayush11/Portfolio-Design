# Portfolio-Design
• Designed Diversified Portfolio using Dynamic Programming and Markowitz Theory and compared the approaches
• Trained LSTM Model with Adam optimizer, achieving 83% accuracy in predicting the share prices of selected stocks.
• Applied Unbounded knapsack Algorithm with a constraint of allocating at most two-fifths of net capital to a stock.
• Engineered risk-adjusted alternative with Markowitz Theory, optimizing Sharpe Ratio where risk-free rate is FD rate.
• Markowitz Theory has an edge in risk-reward profile while Knapsack maximizes returns with a balanced portfolio.
• Tested with 5 shares Adani, HUL, Axis, Airtel and Bajaj for 20 days.
• Got a return of 6.8% with Knapsack and 6.3% with Markowitz.
